# A-NOVEL-ONLINE-FAIR-TASK-ALLOCATION-USING-INTELLIGENCE-RANDOMIZED-ASSIGNMENT-:MACHINE-LEARNING-APPROCH
This project investigates the problem of fair task allocation in an electronic devices service-repair company. The variety of repair operations, as well as the difference in the cost of repairing each of them, was the main motivation for designing a fair method for allocating repair devices (task) to the technicians of this company. Four different allocation scenarios were designed and evaluated to achieve this goal based on the amount of information at hand. To design these allocation scenarios, which are completely online, Integer programming (IP), Machine Learning (ML) approach, as well as random allocation and their combination approaches were used and compared.
